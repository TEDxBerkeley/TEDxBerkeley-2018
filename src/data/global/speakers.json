Driven by a fierce belief that everyone deserves the right to be clean, she was inspired to build Lava Mae after learning about the appalling lack of showers and toilets available to people experiencing homelessness across this country.<br/><br/>Her mobile hygiene odyssey began with an inherent understanding that collaboration across the sectors was key to making Lava Mae a success. With the help of the Mayor’s Office of Housing, Opportunity, Engagement and Partnership, partnerships were seeded with some of the city’s most respected nonprofit homeless providers, city agencies from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and companies such as Google.<br/><br/>In the three-and-a-half years since launching its service, Lava Mae has transformed the lives of more than 10,000 Californians and is scaling by sharing an open source toolkit to respond to the 1,600+ requests for help from communities as far away as Zimbabwe and Mongolia and as close as Los Angeles and San Jose. Doniece’s goal is to enable 1M new showers around the globe over the next two years.<br/><br/>Doniece credits the international visibility Lava Mae has achieved both to the cord it’s striking and to her extensive marketing/branding/PR experience. Before tackling hygiene for the homeless, Doniece spent the previous decade working in the arts as head of marketing at the San Jose Museum of Art – growing the coveted young adult audience by over 200% in two years, and then as Chief External Relations Officer for ZERO1 — an organization dedicated to showcasing the work of some of the most fertile minds from the worlds of art, science, design, architecture, and technology - where she helped secure major funding, shaped programming, and developed and stewarded the brand.<br/><br/>Her private sector experience includes work with major companies such as Coca Cola, Informix, DoubleClick, ToysRUs.com and a host of small San Francisco-based design companies she helped brand.  She began her career as a Legislative Research Analyst in Texas.<br/><br/>Accolades include: 2017: CNN Hero, Irvine Leadership Award, YBCA 100, Woman of the Year, CA Legislature, Bright Idea by the Innovations in American Government Awards; 2016: KIND Award; AIASF Community Alliance Award/Social Impact; Harmony in Hope Award; 2016 Hispanicize Positive Impact Award. 2015: Women in the World’s Mother of Invention Award; Department on the Status of Women, Woman of the Year; Senator Mark Leno honoree Woman of the Year, 2014: Red Cross Community Hero; Janice Mirikitani Legacy Award; Project Homeless Connect’s Innovator of the Year honoree. But Doniece is most proud of the honor bestowed upon her by her 10-year old daughter who calls her a Homeless Super Hero.",

Teresa’s research is motivated by her Aboriginal Tsimshian heritage and the guidance provided by her Grandfather to become a fisheries scientist. For her dissertation Dr. Ryan examined colonial dispossession of Aboriginal lands and trade. The ecologic and social harmony enjoyed by Aboriginal peoples was dismantled, with enormous costs to them, to the natural resources, and colonial society. This Aboriginal view is likely to prompt inquiry across disciplines into how Aboriginal cultures and economy are understood. For her argument she used a framework to explore Ancestral ecological-social institution linkages in terms that better portray an Aboriginal viewpoint and the connection of these complex adaptive systems to heterogeneous mosaic landscapes. She demonstrated how thousands of years of sustainable use based on the synergistic Aboriginal knowledge of cyclic resource production and variability was an intuitive component of Aboriginal stewardship.<br/><br/>Dr. Ryan seeks to conduct research that shows how things are connected at the aquatic-terrestrial interface and species inter-dependencies in complex adaptive systems. Her current research investigates Aboriginal salmon fishing technology and strategies that were used to increase abundance and maintain salmon biological diversity while contributing marine-derived nitrogen to coastal forests. The synchronicity of salmon and forests are so intertwined that changes to the rhythmic cycles of either may affect the other. Marine-derived nitrogen is transported into the forest by salmon predators and made available along mycorrhizal networks below ground among the trees providing a vital nutrient for forest health.<br/><br/>Dr. Ryan has contributed Aboriginal perspectives at several domestic and international levels. She is currently appointed as Scientist – Pacific Salmon Commission Joint Chinook Technical Committee (Canada), Member of the Circle of Experts for the Assembly of First Nations Advisory Committee on Climate Action and the Environment (ACCAE); and Member of the (Vancouver Fraser Port Authority) Enhancing Cetacean Habitat and Observations (ECHO) Technical Working Group. She has previously served as Vice Chair – BC Pacific Salmon Forum; Director - BC Aquatic Foods Resources Society; and has participated in Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat committees. She is a photographer and cedar basket weaver attending art markets and shows such as the Heard Museum (AZ) and SW Indian Art Market in Santa Fe (NM).",

But these past few years, after working for a senator during some time in France, he realized that change could only come from civil society. Deeply impacted by the lack of interest of the politicians in his homecountry for making people's lives better and countering extremism, he grew the desire to work as hard as possible with 'everyday people' in order to counter the lack of interest of the politicians. After the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in January 2015 in Paris, he created a global NGO called Citizen's Awakening, that has for a goal to counter extremism and create understanding through bringing together people, through dialogue. Citizen's Awakening now is present in Canada, the UK, India, Hungary, France, and many other countries. Impacted on a personnal level by the Paris attacks of November 2015, he pledged to fight as hard as he could againt terrorism worldwide with what he believes is the most powerful weapon on the long term to tackle extremism : our ability so speak up, and to create bridges between different communities and different countries. François Reyes is also a speaker and an ambassador for One Young World & the Quilliam Foundation, and a member of the FATE (Families Against Terrorism & Extremism) network. He's in the middle of writing a book gathering the voices and solutions of/from/for families impacted one way or the other by terrorism, whether they lost a member of their family in a terrorist attack, or a child to the extremist-narrative.

In times like these, in the world that we live in, there’s something relevant, significant and necessary about Damien – and people like him. You can go to pretty much any search engine, put \"Damien Horne\" in the search field and read about his life story and credentials. The cliff notes is he’s from Hickory, North Carolina. He’s one of twelve children (a blended family). He’s a middle child, adores his mother, is the first in his family to earn a high school diploma and now devotes a lot of his time and resources trying to make a better life for his loved ones and those around him. Although they didn’t grow up with a lot of monetary wealth (barely any to speak of), Damien’s mother had a love for God that inspired him to develop a personal relationship with Christ at the age of 7. <br/><br/>It’s there where his hope journey began…<br/><br/>The loss of brothers, experiencing family members being incarcerated and figuring out how to make ends meet led Damien to want more for himself. As a young adult, he first moved to LA. After being homeless a couple of years, he returned back to North Carolina and saved enough money to move to Nashville. Damien found himself homeless again. Only this time, a country star by the name of John Rich (of Big & Rich) put a nice chunk of change in his guitar case – and extended an invitation…to basically a whole new life.<br/><br/>As a musician.<br/>As a public speaker.<br/>As a world changer.<br/><br/>From Faith Hill and Keith Urban to Robert Randolph and John Legend, Damien has either opened up for or performed alongside these award-winning artists. He’s also been part of a country trio The Farm. He’s also had a publishing deal with Warner Chapel and released several solo projects including his latest EP The Love Saga Vol. 1. Yes, he has a few bragging rights.<br/><br/>But if you were to ask Damien what he’s most passionate about, his answer might surprise you. After receiving his associate’s degree from Free Will Baptist Bible College and becoming an ordained minister, Damien is intentional about giving back.<br/><br/>Giving back by sharing his testimony.<br/><br/>Giving back by serving at his home church, The Salvation Army.<br/><br/>Giving back by offering words of encouragement, support and faith – anywhere he can.<br/><br/>Damien recently started a blog that centers around his mission to surround others with hope. It’s called encourageinspiremotivate.com. Each week, there are new videos and articles on platforms he’s committed to: homelessness, human trafficking, prison ministry, world outreach, youth, adoption and the Word. That said, it should come as no surprise that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Gandhi and Mother Teresa are some of his \"purpose mentors\" and life heroes.<br/><br/>\"Music is a talent God’s given me,\" shares Damien. \"It’s a tool that has opened up so many doors that I’m thankful for. But my heart is to speak to and reach out to as many people as I can. I want to let them know that their purpose and dreams are possible. Every day, I wake up with that on my mind. Every night, I fall asleep hoping that I did my best to inspire those I came into contact with.\"<br/><br/>Yep. Anyone who thinks like that is relevant, significant – and very necessary. <br/><br/>Indeed. For such a time as this. <br/>",

      "description": "Bio:<br/><br/>Music and storytelling have always been a vital part of Charles\u00cd life growing up in the South. However, despite thorough tutelage from his staunchly religious grandmother, who insisted upon him learning church hymns as a child, Charles never aspired to walk the path of a performing artist. He dreamed of playing professional football. After a disappointing end to his athletic career, he then pursued a career in Corporate America with IBM. After two successful years as a sales representative, he left to spearhead a regional office of another large company. A year from the date he started, he was fired. It wasn\u00cdt until a friend encouraged his potential as a singer and actor that Charles\u00cd love for music resurfaced.<br/><br/>In July1996, Charles, led by intuition, left the comforts of the South with $400 dollars for the bright lights of Broadway. He has since starred in some of the most celebrated and spectacular productions in American theatre history including Smokey Joe\u00cds Caf_, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Lion King. He was the first African American to play the role of \u00efRocky\u00cd in the European tour of The Rocky Horror Show. Charles adds guest starring roles in Law & Order: Criminal Intent, All My Children, the award winning independent film Anne B. Real, and the thought provoking comedy, Ed\u00cds Trip. He received national acclaim and rave reviews for his 20-character portrayal in his one-man stage play Black Boy, based on best selling author Richard Wright\u00cds autobiographical landmark, as well as his portrayal of Civil Rights activist and icon, W.E.B. Du Bois in the one-man production, The Smoke King. Charles recently toured the country in Never Fight a Shark in Water, a one-man play based on the life of Gregory Bright who was exonerated after spending 27 _ years in  Louisiana\u00cds Angola Penitentiary for wrongful conviction of second-degree murder.<br/><br/>Charles with fellow actor Gerald C. Rivers will present and tour the world premiere event Martin & Music in January 2012. The play chronicles the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., while threading King\u00cds love for music into his speeches and life experience.<br/><br/>Charles has entertained sold-out audiences around the world, including The John F. Kennedy Center The Turkish-American Association in Ankara, Turkey, and Rikers Island Correctional Facility. He speaks to groups and organizations and serves as facilitator of workshops based on his work as an artist in order to empower, encourage, and uplift  audiences everywhere.<br/><br/>Agape Media International released Charles\u00cd second album Rushing Over Me project in fall 2010, after his debut album, I Am, was released to critical acclaim. Charles tours colleges, universities, and spiritual centers around the world performing his \u00efSole\u00cd Music Concert Series: A journey through an African American quilt of song.<br/><br/>Intuitive Rebel, Charles\u00cd landmark book about his journey in finding his own unique voice and life purpose will be released in Spring 2012.",

He serves on the advisory boards of the Seva Foundation, the Dalai Lama Foundation, and Greater Good Science Center.<br/><br/>Nipun\u00cds high-school goal was to either become a tennis-pro or a Himalayan Yogi. Instead, by the third year of his Computer Science and Philosophy degree at UC Berkeley, he started his software career at Sun Microsystems. Dissatisfied by the dot-com greed of the late 90s, Nipun went to a homeless shelter with three friends to \u00f1give with absolutely no strings attached.\u00ee They ended up creating a website, and also an organization titled ServiceSpace. Over the years, they built thousands of websites for nonprofits but also started incubating a diverse set of projects that included online portals DailyGood and KarmaTube, offline movements like Smile Cards, a pay-it-forward rickshaw in India, and Karma Kitchen restaurants in three cities across the US. In 2001, at the age of 25, Nipun quit his job to become a \u00f1full time volunteer.\u00ee He didn\u00cdt have a plan of survival beyond six months, but so far, so good.<br/><br/>In January 2005, Nipun and Guri, his wife of six months, put everything aside to embark on an open-ended, unscripted walking pilgrimage in India, to \u00f1use our hands to do random acts of kindness, our heads to profile inspiring people, and our hearts to cultivate truth.\u00ee Living on a dollar a day, eating wherever food was offered, sleeping wherever a flat surface was found, the couple walked 1000 kilometers before ending up at a retreat center, where they meditated for three months. Today, both Nipun and Guri live in Berkeley and stay rooted in a practice of small acts of service. The journey continues.<br/><br/>Nipun\u00cds mission statement in life now reads: \u00f1Bring smiles in the world and stillness in my heart.\u00ee",

She has performed with many of Spain\u00cds finest artists, including Alejandro Granados, Antonio \u00f1El Pipa,\u00ee Manuel and Antonio Malena, Domingo Ortega, Enrique \u00f1El Extremeno,\u00ee Yeye de C\u00e0diz, Mateo Sole\u00e0, El Junco, Juan Ogalla, Geronimo, Felipe Maya and others.

An average high school student with little motivation and no money to go to college, Carolyn graduated from beauty school to realize she had little interest in the trade. In order to make ends meet, she began waiting tables, a job she held for over a decade. Working in an exclusive restaurant atop of the Hyatt Chicago, wearing the mandatory uniform designed to appeal to the male clientele (including four-inch high heels), she waited on business men & women from all over the country. As a single mother, working for tips and living hand-to-mouth, it was barely enough to cover rent and feed her two kids. Something had to change.<br/>The change arrived one day when the roof of the restaurant was damaged in a storm, forcing Carolyn to find work quickly. She walked into an employment office and said she wanted a sales job. The counsellor looked at Carolyn, at her previous work experience, and said the best he could do was a Customer Service position at a freight company.<br/>Entering the male-dominated freight industry, Carolyn dedicated herself to learning the business and soon found herself in the sales position. A few years later, as the industry became de-regulated, Carolyn recognized an opportunity and started her own business, New Age Transportation, Distribution & Warehousing, Inc.<br/>As her business flourished, Carolyn never forgot the struggles she endured as a single mother trying to make ends meet as a waitress. With a desire to help ease the financial burdens single, working parents encounter, she created the Expect A Miracle Foundation. The non-profit organization provides assistance for children\u00cds extra-curricular activities _ an expense many single parents struggle to afford. Since 2001, the organization has helped nearly 6000 children!<br/>The dynamic author of Everything I Know as a CEO I Learned as a Waitress, Carolyn outlines her principles for success _ which can be applied within business and in one\u00cds personal life. Sharing her life experiences and inspirational thoughts, the confidence her writing instills in the reader to take their own journey is undeniable. Her latest book, The Miracle Path, captures the hope, strength, and courage of others as they continue on their life\u00cds journey. A must-read for anyone that needs a little encouragement in pursuit of a miracle!<br/>Carolyn generates the spark that you need to believe in yourself and to achieve your goals. She is living proof that individuals can overcome obstacles, beat the odds, and succeed. Hearing her tell her story, her words of inspiration, and her positive approach to the most difficult situations is as insightful to the CEO as it is to the single parent.",

      "description": "Eric Holt-Gim_nez has been Executive Director of Food First since 2006. He is the editor of the Food First bookFood Movements Unite! Strategies to Transform Our Food Systems; co-author of Food Rebellions! Crisis and the Hunger for Justice with Raj Patel and Annie Shattuck; and author of the book Campesino a Campesino: Voices from Latin America\u00cds Farmer to Farmer Movement for Sustainable Agriculture and of many academic, magazine and news articles. Of Basque and Puerto Rican heritage, Eric grew up milking cows and pitching hay in Point Reyes, CA, where he learned that putting food on the table is hard work. After studying rural education and biology at the University of Oregon and Evergreen State College, he traveled through Mexico and Central America, where he was drawn to the simple life of small-scale farmers.<br/><br/>When he arrived to work in the community of Vicente Guerrero in the impoverished state of Tlaxcala, Mexico in 1977, the place was surrounded by eroded and deforested hills and farmers were not able to grow enough food to feed their families. But the village did have a small elementary school and an energetic young mayor and Eric enthusiastically joined his efforts to revitalize the community. They started a school garden, a water project, a health clinic and a sewing coop. Several Mayan farmers from Guatemala visited at just the right time to lead a field course on soil and water conservation that helped restore the degraded environment and boost farmer\u00cds yields. From that experience, the Campesino a Campesino (farmer to farmer) movement was born. In the four decades since, this peasant-led sustainable agriculture movement has spread steadily across Latin America\u0084creating innovative farming methods, raising yields and improving livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of small farmers and their families.<br/><br/>After spending over twenty-five years with the resourceful farmers of Central America and Mexico, Eric holds a deep appreciation for the value and power of building local food systems. But he has also become painfully aware that working locally is never going to be enough to bring about the larger changes that are needed: \u00f1Small farmers and underserved urban communities need changes in national food policies and international trade rules to have a fighting chance of feeding themselves and building healthy, prosperous livelihoods.\u00ee<br/><br/>Eric has a MSc. in International Agricultural Development from University of California at Davis and a PhD in Environmental Studies from the University of California at Santa Cruz . He has taught Development Studies at UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, Boston University and the National Gastronomic University in Pollenzo, Italy. Prior to working at Food First, he served as the Latin America Program Manager for the Bank Information Center (BIC) in Washington DC.<br/><br/>In Eric\u00cds words, \u00f1successful social movements are formed by integrating activism with livelihoods. These integrated movements create the sustained social pressure that produces political will\u0084the key to changing the financial, governmental and market structures that presently work against sustainability.\u00ee",

Her company is www.UnconditionalLeadership.com.<br/><br/>During her 20s she worked various administrative roles in art, design and consulting companies, and started to train and perform in theater at night. Building skill in accounting led to consultancy with clients in design, tech and manufacturing. The business afforded flexibility for her passion, theater, while she built a practice as a trusted advisor to entrepreneurial, innovative clients. The next 10 years were business consultant by day, singer-actress by night, and not much sleep.<br/><br/>In 2005, after much soul-searching, she closed the consulting business and put aside singing to find focus on a single career combining left brain and right brain, arts, technology and business. This intention led her to Apple\u00cds iTunes, where she helped build the digital content business in TV and Movies.<br/><br/>During the Apple years, life stabilized, she watched a lot of TV, and immersed herself in tech.

Back in civilian clothes, she enrolled at Rimon, Israel\u00cds leading contemporary music school where she was turned off by the humdrum of music theory and Israeli pop culture songwriting. She soon fled to India to deepen studies in Indian spirituality and Hindustani Classical Vocal music, as well as a long, sordid love affair that helped her hone her skill in writing heartbreak songs.<br/><br/>Yonat returned to the US in 2008 and moved to San Francisco to pursue a masters degree in psychotherapy.

She studied and later worked closely with Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais with whom she began her path to better understand how the brain can change itself and how to apply brain plasticity principles _ a distinction that did not exist at the time _ to improve people\u00cds lives.<br/><br/>Anat is the author of the bestselling book, Move Into Life, The Nine Essentials for Lifelong Vitality, where she describes breakthrough, yet simple ways, to access the remarkable powers of our brains to create new patterns that transform our lives for the better. She has worked with a wide range of students from professional musicians such as the San Francisco Symphony and the Tanglewood Music Center to dancers, athletes and regular folk, helping them overcome debilitating pain, RSI symptoms, injury and most importantly, helping them reach new levels of performance and well being both physically and mentally. She is currently writing a book about her work with special needs children for Penguin Group. She is also a contributor to the Huffington Post.<br/><br/>Anat is internationally known for her work with children with special needs from a few days old to teenagers. Her understanding of how to use movement and touch, combined with attention and other mental processes, offers a scientifically-based breakthrough method for helping these children. The changes in these children (and in adults) often reach beyond what is considered possible.<br/><br/>Her theory is being validated more and more by recent brain research and her work has been endorsed by medical doctors and leading brain scientists. Dr Michael Merzenich, famed neuroscientist and member of the National academy of sciences, describes the work Anat has developed as, \u00f1powerful, practical strategies for improving your abilities and your brain that are strongly supported by the neuroscience of brain plasticity.\u00ee Anat envisions profound transformations in the areas of fitness, rehabilitation, anti-aging, vitality, and therapy for special needs children once the focus will shift from \u00f1the body\u00ee to the brain. As brain plasticity principles and applications are more widely understood and implemented in these areas, it will lead to surprisingly better and quicker outcomes with significantly less suffering in the process.",
